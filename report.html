    <h1>Isa Phuyuthanon</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The news covered on my website are Thailand and World news.
        User can also search any news from all over the world by using
        SEARCH option in the menu. I am using News API for this option
        sadly its not available for production.

        The structure of my website inlcuding 5 html pages namely home page,
        THAILAND (for Thai news), WORLD (for World news), SEARCHâ„¢, and Subscribe pages.
        Coding wise, I seperated each CSS, HTML and JS in folder for easy readability.
    </p>
    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bangkok Post is my favorite local news paper</li>
        <li>Blue is my favorite color therefore many of the component are blue</li>
        <li>Bangkok Post website is very well implemented and is suitable for any size of devices</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>My website can help those who have visulally impaired access photo and video by using <i>alt</i> attribute
        </li>
        <li>Every button has its title making it easy for hearing impaired person to know what does the button do</li>
        <li>I have try to put
        <li>lang</li> attribute so that screen reader can read</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>People of all ages can use this website, the navigation is clear</li>
        <li>People with difference size of device can see content without distruption, it is suitable for every device
        </li>
        <li>Menu, content and footer are designed based on the standard of W3 school</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Learning</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have learnt CSS grid layout by W3 School and from google specifically from
            https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/</li>
        <li>I have learnt how to fetch data from API by watching videos, reading NEWSapi documentation from here:
            https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything</li>
        <li>I have learnt how make a slides using javascript where learnt from W3 school</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Evaluation I</h2>
    <p>
        I am so pround with this project especially because I have zero experience with coding and designing website.
        One aspect that I was scared was how do I make everything responsive because CSS concept is challenge to me but
        I was able to do it because of the resources available online that have helped me a lot.

        Another aspact that I think it is succesfully but very challenging was to implemented an API, but thank to many
        video
        explaining how to implemented it and how to use API from the documentation, I also learnt that literature
        document is as
        important as the actual function.
    </p>
    <h2>Evaluation II</h2>
    <p>
        Things I could improve are consistency in my website for example button are all different, font are different as
        well. Next time
        If I am doing it again, I would put more hours in designing; decide for color pallatte, using many standard
        available in the website.
    </p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing display-carousel function I have modified it from:
